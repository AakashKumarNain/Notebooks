# Quadratic Weighted Kappa 

Quadratic weighted kappa, which measures the agreement between two ratings. This metric typically varies from `0` (random agreement between raters) to `1` (complete agreement between raters). In the event that there is less agreement between the raters than expected by chance, the metric may go below `0`. The quadratic weighted kappa is calculated between the scores which are expected/known and the predicted scores.
