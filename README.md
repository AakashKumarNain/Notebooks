# Machine Learning the hard way

The aim of these notebooks is to try out new things, implement some research papers, or simply to show how to write efficient code in Python

I don't know why I am calling this notebook as `Machine Learning the hard way`. Is it because that this going to contains all examples just related to Machine Learning? Puff, hell no!
