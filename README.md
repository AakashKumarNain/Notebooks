# Machine Learning the hard way

The aim of these notebooks is to try out new things, implement some research papers, or simply to show how to write efficient code in Python

I literally have no idea why I named this repo as `Machine Learning the hard way`. 
Is it because that this repo is going to contain all examples related to Machine Learning only? Puff, hell no!
